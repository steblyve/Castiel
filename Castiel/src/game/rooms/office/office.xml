				The acient civilization of Bable is well known for there
				atempt to reach heaven
				by building a tower higher than any
				other.Acording to the Bible the
				tower was an
				statement from the humans
				to god that they want to reach his greatnes by
				reaching
				heaven
				themself. God saw th faith of the humans in danger and brought
				destruction
				over the people as a grim reminder of to the people. The
				tower broke
				down and god
				createt language. The acient civilisations
				could not communicate with each
				other
				and so they parted ways with no
				means to rebuild the tower ever again.
				Parts of the mentioned tower
				where found in east european country
				indicating
				that the tower really
				existet. But not close to as high as descripted in
				the bible.
				Strange.Some pages seem to be missing.
