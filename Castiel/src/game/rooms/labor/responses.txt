At the side there is a shelf.

A weird looking stone glowing slightly red. about 1m in hight. You feel a strange Energy 
comming from it.

To heavy. but i can touch it.

#touchStone:
As you touch the stone the red glow gets stronger. you see the memories of an acient 
civilisation passing trough you mind. You see parts of the past and future. 
It is almost as you would watch trough the eyes of someone else. 
With a bright light you get pushed back. Your head hurts.

#inspectBody:
A bloody mess of an corpse. You cant make out who it is nor if it was even human.
A long scar is going over the stomache of the corpse.
