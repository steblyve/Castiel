				As you touch the stone the red glow gets stronger. you see
				the memories of an acient civilisation passing trough you mind. 
				You see parts of the past and future. It is almost as you would watch
				trough the eyes of someone else. With a bright light you get pushed
				back. 
				Your head hurts.
